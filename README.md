# milestone-project-1
This is the first milestone project for Runshaw College and Code Institute.
## 1. UX
### Project goals
Hi! This is my portfolio website. I created a simple site about my skillsets and work experiences, so potential future employers can check my CV, and see how I improved my skills, and knowledge about web development. On the first page, I want to introduce my personality and tell a little story about myself. The next page is about my work history. Here I made 5 categories, and visitors can check them in more detail if they are interested. The third page is about my programming skills, how well I know the different programming languages, frameworks, and any other soft skills, that are important in a job, and learned them while working in other industries. 
### Developer and business goals
As a developer, I wanted to create a user-friendly website, so I tried to use more graphic elements than text, but something, that still explains my message, and is engaging. Also, this message should be well organized and checked in different screen sizes. So if the content was too long, I was breaking it up into smaller pieces, which is easier to digest.
### User stories
Users can easily navigate through the different webpages, and learn about me as a candidate for a job. They aren't overloaded with information. To help with this, it has a main navigation menu and a structured layout, and the graphics help the users find the way to the contents. 
### Design choices
This is a User Centric Frontend Development project. Used semantic markup to structure HTML code. The code is split into readable, separated lines, and I included comments in every section. I used Bootstrap in the design, which has lots of pre-written code, so speeds up the process, gives ideas to the layout, compatible with the browsers, and it is easy to make a responsive design with it.
* I used Lato from fonts.google.com, because of readability.

### Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to create my wireframe, which you can check here [Link to the wireframe](/Milestone-project1.pdf). There are wireframes for 3 different screen sizes, and my project contains 3 pages for each screen size. I modified my wireframe a couple of times, this is the latest version. When I started the wireframe, I was flexible, I did not try to make exactly the same in the final version of my website. So I just used it as a guideline during the design process. It helped me to position things and organize my content.
## 2. Features
### 1. Existing features
  * Easy to use navigation bar, contact form to fill in, and email me. 
  * Downloadable CV, if anybody needs my CV in pdf format. 
  * Links to my social media sites, which open in separate tabs. 
  * Dropdown menus for my online CV, and categorized job history.
### 2.  Future features
* Better links to my projects so that future employers can check them out here, and don't need to go to github. 
## 3. Technologies used
I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for this project. Balsamiq for my wireframe. Bootstrap and CSS media queries ensure, that the layout changes appropriately across different device screen sizes.
## 4. Testing
* I used official W3C validator for HTML.
* Official (jigsaw) validator for CSS.
## 5. Deployment
I deployed the project with GitHub pages.
