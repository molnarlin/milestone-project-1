# milestone-project-1
This is the first milestone project for Runshaw College and Code Institute.
## 1. UX
### Project goals
This is a web developer's portfolio site. I want to introduce myself, my job history, my skillsets, and my experiences to potential future employers. 
### Developer and business goals
### User stories
Users can easily navigate through the different webpages, and learn about me as a candidate for a job. To help with this, it has a main navigation menu and a structured layout, graphics are consistent in style and colour. It was important to follow accessibility guidelines. The purpose of my website should be immediately evident to users. 
### Design choices
This is a User Centric Frontend Development project. Used semantic mark-up to structure HTML code. Code is split into readable, separated lines, and has comments in every section.
